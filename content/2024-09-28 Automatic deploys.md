If you can see this post then that means I was able to set up a GitHub workflow to automatically build and deploy my blog every time I push a new post. This post was generated from a template using an iOS shortcut and then written in iA Writer and pushed to GitHub using Working Copy. I will write a more in-depth post about how I am doing all this!
