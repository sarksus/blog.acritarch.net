I have been playing Monster Hunter 4U these past few weeks and it’s been awesome. I love the whole traveling around with a crew on a caravan concept. All I need in life is the Guildmarm calling me Doodle.

It is really interesting to see how less accommodating the game is compared to World/Rise. I have to be much more deliberate with my glaive attacks and there is less room for error when vaulting up for an air attack. The environments are so pretty too. Walking out onto the Ancestral Steppes is breathtaking.

It makes me want to play Monster Hunter 1. It is apparently even more inhospitable to human life! Lots of gathering, weird monster hit boxes, very careful attacking and repositioning. I doubt I’d finish it but I wanna try it out. I am somewhat still used to the jank from that era of games.
