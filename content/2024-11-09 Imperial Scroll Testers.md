when you got cursed scrolls floating around in your empire as adventurers unearth unspeakable artifacts you probably need a division that deals with these things, like is it cursed, what's the curse, can it be removed, can we analyze the structure of the scroll to read its contents without activating it. they'd need a really good benefits package, what if someone gets cursed, gotta take care of their families

they are developing magically treated blastshields that can sever the space between the scroll and the technician working on the scroll in case the curse is accidentally activated. it's like those sawstop things you know where they show you how it works with a hot dog that barely gets nicked by the saw before it immediately stops, except we're severing the spacetime continuum.
